Atomistic simulations are a powerful computational technique for exploring material behavior at the atomic scale. At the core of any atomistic simulation lies a description of the interactions between atoms that produces the forces governing their motion. <br><br>

We develop both physics-based and machine learning interatomic potentials to model these interactions and apply them to study materials for renewable energy and information applications. We also develop model analysis frameworks, such as those for reliability and uncertainty quantification, to make atomistic simulations more reliable, reproducible, and accessible.
