Renewable energy storage is essential for building a sustainable future, with advanced batteries playing a critical role in enabling reliable grid integration of solar and wind power. Our research develops the fundamental science needed for next-generation, grid-scale storage systems.<br><br>

We apply theoretical and multiscale computational methods to investigate key challenges in battery systems, including ion transport mechanisms, interface phenomena, and degradation processes across multiple scales.
