Atomistic simulations are a powerful computational technique for exploring material behavior at the atomic scale. At the core of any atomistic simulation lies a description of the interactions between atoms that produces the forces governing their motion. <br><br>

We develop both physics-based and machine learning interatomic potentials to model these interactions.
To ensure the robustness of these models, we also develop analysis frameworks, such as those for uncertainty quantification and propagation, to make atomistic simulations more reliable, reproducible, and accessible.
