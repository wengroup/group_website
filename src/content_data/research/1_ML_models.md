Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning, have significantly expanded the toolbox for constructing predictive and generative scientific models. These models make it possible to accurately and efficiently explore the gigantic design space of new materials and chemicals. <br><br>

Our group pioneers the development of novel AI algorithms that integrate core physical principles to create such models and advance their capabilities. These algorithms enable both the precise forecasting of material properties and the intelligent design of new compounds with targeted functions.
