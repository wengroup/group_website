Machine learning methods, especially deep learning, have significantly expanded a chemist's toolbox, enabling the construction of quantitatively predictive models directly from data. These models make it possible to explore the gigantic chemical space to make chemical discoveries.<br><br>

Our group focus on the chemical reaction space. We develop novel graph neural networks that are able to represent any chemical reactions with bond alterations and apply them to model reaction properties such as reaction energy, reaction type, and activation energy. These models have been used to investigate the reaction pathways in battery electrolytes.
