Quantum chemical theory and computations are powerful tools for understanding and designing materials. Conventional approaches that manually perform the calculations are difficult to manage complex materials science workflows and difficult to fully utilize modern high-performance computing resources.<br><br>

Building on top of the software stack that powers the Materials Project, we develop high-throughput materials discovery pipelines for density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning techniques, and apply them to search for materials for renewable energy and information applications.
