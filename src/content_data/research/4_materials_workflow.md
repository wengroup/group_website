Quantum chemical theory and computations are powerful tools for understanding and designing materials. Conventional approaches that manually perform the calculations are difficult to manage complex materials science workflows and difficult to fully utilize modern high-performance computing resources.<br><br>

Building on top of the software stack that powers the Materials Project, we develop high-throughput materials discovery recipes for density functional theory (DFT) and apply them to discover new materials with unique mechanical and photonic properties with applications in solid-state batteries and thermal-photonic devices.
