We are a computational group working in the broad area of chemical and materials sciences at the [University of Houston](https://www.chee.uh.edu/faculty/wen-mingjian).
An overarching theme of our group is to leverage artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and atomistic molecular simulations to understand and design new materials for renewable energy and healthcare applications.
We develop state-of-the-art machine learning models, cutting-edge automation workflows, and advanced reliability analysis frameworks, and apply them to study Li-ion and solid-state batteries, zeolite catalysts, and thermal-photonic devices.
